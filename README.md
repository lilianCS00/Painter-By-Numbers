# Painter-By-Numbers

The project aimed to create a model capable of determining whether two given images were created by the same artist. This was achieved using Siamese Networks to analyze image pairs, with a pre-trained ResNet34 architecture employed to extract meaningful features. Triplet loss was utilized during training to enhance the modelâ€™s ability to differentiate between artists, while data augmentation techniques were applied to improve dataset diversity and reduce overfitting. The model achieved an artist classification accuracy of over 80% on the test dataset, highlighting its effectiveness in recognizing artistic styles.
